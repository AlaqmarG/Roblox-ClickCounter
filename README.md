## What does UI Labs do?
UI Labs allow you to proto-type your user-interface, so you don't have to run the game each time to be able to preview what your UI might look like.
It also comes a couple more handy tools to help you get to your desired layout a little quicker. This project comes configured with a story to preview the entire user interface, and couple controls to let you see what different states of the UI might look like.

## Okay, whats the game about?
It's a super simple game:
- Click "Click" to increment your clicks
- Click "Reset" to reset your counter

And with the power of Lyra, your clicks will save for the next time you return, right were you left off!!!
